Connecting business and design at a strategic level is a necessary step in bringing brands to life. This process often requires a collaborative effort across multiple skillsets and departments. It also requires a deeper understanding of the company, their customers and how the two coexist. Join eMedia Design Co., a downtown Cincinnati brand experience firm, to learn about design process tips and discuss key areas necessary in designing for the brand experience. Want to stand out in the industry? Ready to take your process to the next level? We'll show you the way. Coffee and light breakfast included, thank you to eMedia Design Co for hosting this #CDW17 event!</p> <p>Speakers:</p> <ul> <li>Catherine Crichlow, Vice President</li> <li>Autumn Crosier, Brand Experience Director</li> </ul> <p>Sponsored by emedia design</p> <p><a href="http://cincinnati.aiga.org/event/shifting-the-paradigm-of-design-for-brand-experience/" class=button>Buy Your Tickets For This Event</a></p> </div> <div class=event id=tandem> <h3>Mon, Sept 25</h3> <h2>In Tandem: How Designers and Developers Work Together</h2> <h4><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/sKKus9EAEiv">Union Hall // Homeroom</a> | 11:30 - 1 | FREE - $10</h4> <p>Design and development are too often viewed as separate disciplines with distance between them. But we know the secret to success: working together.</p> <p>In this panel discussion, designers and developers (and those in-between) will discuss how they collaborate on their teams. We will explore the challenges teams face when working with different disciplines, and how to overcome them.</p> <p>Speakers</p> <ul> <li>Ryan Cayabyab, Product Manager, Alchemy</li> <li>Patrick Hildebrandt, UX/UI Designer, Everything But The House</li> <li>Sam Borstadt, UX Designer, Paycor</li> <li>Lauren Lawson, Junior Developer, Alchemy</li> <li>Sean Davis, Senior Developer, Ample</li> </ul> <p>Come and have lunch (provided) with us!

The good news: design-thinkers have an edge. While that’s a very serious topic, we’d like to invite you to an evening where we don’t take ourselves too seriously. Please join us for a game-like collaborative experience full of lightning-fast design prototyping that we’re calling “Box of Crazy.”</p> <p><strong>How it will work:</strong></p> <p>Openfield Creative will present attendees with a shortlist of challenges that you will vote on. We will then divide the room into teams who will compete to solve the challenge using a curated box of random and absurd items that you will use to prototype your solutions. Teams will present to a panel of judges who will evaluate the prototypes and make awards in the following categories:</p> <ul> <li>Most Ingenious</li> <li>Most Hilarious</li> <li>Most WTF?!</li> </ul> <p>Let’s kick off Cincinnati Design Week with a fun evening designed to get us all working and laughing together!

If it’s sold in a store, we want to make it better and more beautiful. What if we applied that same mentality to make our city better? At Design Impact, we use design to reimagine how public and social services can better serve those most affected by the problem: by empowering them to be co-designers. Learn how design can be used for good, like fighting childhood hunger, building healthier, safer neighborhoods, and attracting more women to math and science careers. Plus, walk away with ideas on how to use your creative skills to tackle issues in your own community.

AIGA Women Lead has teamed up with designer and sociologist Leyla Acaroglu of Disrupt Design to create the Gender Equity Toolkit. Join us as we use this new resource to bust through one of the leading causes of disparate access to leadership positions in the design field: implicit gender-related bias. This interactive series of activities is open to men and women who are interested in learning more about bias and gender equity. The workshop will be facilitated by AIGA Cincinnati's WomanUp Founder, Autumn Heisler.</p> <p>Speakers:</p> <ul> <li>Autumn Heisler, Co-President + WomanUp Founder, AIGA Cincinnati </li> </ul> <p><a href="http://cincinnati.aiga.org/event/gender-equity-workshop/" class=button>Buy Your Tickets For This Event</a></p> </div> <div class=event id=infographics> <h3>Wed, Sept 27</h3> <h2>Infographics for Social Change: A Graphic Ally Hackathon</h2> <h4><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/QXbqr7pyWMG2">Rookwood Exchange</a> | 8:30 - 10:30 am | FREE - $5</h4> <p>Become a Graphic Ally! Learn how to tell visual data stories to inspire policy change and mobilize information at the grassroots level. In this hands on workshop, we will explore and apply principles of conscious and responsible design to a real world infographic project.

Most of us need to learn to give ourselves the kind of care we give our brands. You shouldn’t be expected to just change design culture overnight though, so, in the middle of #CDW17 this year, AIGA Cincinnati will be giving you tools to de-stress and work on your mental health! Join us for office yoga, an infused water bar, wellness swag and giveaways, and a free healthy lunch from Whole Bowl as we discuss some ways to manage our mental health, sustain creativity and achieve the kind of whole body wellness that will complement your creative career.</p> <p>$5 placeholder tickets will be refunded at the door, or donated to American Foundation for Suicide Prevention at the choice of the ticketholder.</p> <p>Facilitator:</p> <ul> <li>Jessica Stoddard, Wellness Director</li> </ul> <p>Sponsored by Whole Bowl & Modo Yoga</p> <p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/de-stress-to-impress-wellness-strategies-for-sustaining-creativity-tickets-36470193330" class=button>Reserve Your Ticket For This Event</a></p> </div> <div class=event id=good> <h3>Wed, Sept 27</h3> <h2>Designing for Good: Creatively Attacking the Heroin Epidemic</h2> <h4><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Q8tAQpwJXcv">Graydon on Main</a> | 6:00pm - 8:00pm | FREE</h4> <p>The number of people affected by heroin is growing and the degrees of separation are lessening, what can we do to solve it? It’s a well-known problem, nationally and locally in Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky. The heroin epidemic seems almost too big for any one person or organization to fix, but, what if we could break it down and tackle it in a smaller, more manageable way? As creatives, we would like to believe that our work has an impact on the people and world that we live in. Join AIGA Cincinnati for an event - part lecture, part workshop - as we make strides to help those in our city most in need.</p> <p>The workshop portion of the event will have attendees break into groups to creatively brainstorm solutions to two to three issues. Those solutions will be presented to the Ohio Attorney General Board for consideration. Workshop will be led by Kristen Pericleous, Co-VP + Design for Good Director of AIGA Cincinnati. </p> <p>Light bites will be provided. Please come prepared to think, create, and solve.

Carol was a nurse and medical professional for 25 years before she quit her job to unify the fight against heroin in Ohio. She has organized meetings to educate the community, provided resource lists for those suffering from addiction and created the Community Recovery Project, a support and resources group on opiate and heroin addiction. Carol and the Community Recovery Program are fighting simply because “heroin sucks.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/designing-for-good-creatively-attacking-the-heroin-epidemic-tickets-36470485203" class=button>Reserve Your Ticket For This Event</a></p> </div> <div class=event id=handmade> <h3>Thurs, Sept 28</h3> <h2>Handzy: Handmade Card Workshop</h2> <h4><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/paxamTGEyM72">The Frock</a> | 8:00am -10:00am | $15</h4> <p>With today's technology, talking to the people we love is faster than ever before, but we believe a thoughtful card and handwritten message just can't be beat!

Antionette Carroll</h2> <h4><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/GQFUizEJBas">Taft Museum of Art</a> | 6:00 - 7:30 pm | FREE - $15</h4> <p>Design is an invisible innovation that continues to change the world through visual, spatial, and experiential means. Why not use this process to change our neighborhoods, communities, and, ultimately, the human experience for the better? Through equity-centered community design, creative problem solving, social innovation, empathy and humility, designers and community members alike can improve global difficulties and challenge human rights and social justice issues. Hear Antionette Carroll, the Founder, President and CEO of Creative Reaction Lab, discuss how August 9, 2014 and Ferguson, MO changed her from a typical 9-to-5 graphic designer to a social entrepreneur, facilitator, community organizer, and social impact design advocate; the lessons she has learned so far on her journey; and how design (and you) can create social and civic transformations.</p> <p>Speakers:</p> <ul> <li>Antionette Carroll, President & CEO, Creative Reaction Lab</li> </ul> <p>About our speaker: Antionette D. Carroll is the Founder and CEO of Creative Reaction Lab, social enterprise that educates, trains, and challenges cities to co-create solutions with Black and Latinx populations to design healthy and racially equitable communities.

EMERGE is a series of experiences tailored to help the emerging designer hone their skills, discover their talents, and grow their career. AIGA Cincinnati is excited to be participating in this initiative by hosting a mini-conference created specifically for emerging designers by emerging designers (those with 0-5 years of experience). This half-day event will include two engaging panel discussions, the choice of a keynote speaker based on your interests, and a workshop to help you refine your professional social media presence. The day also includes time for networking, free professional head shots, unlimited coffee, breakfast + snacks. The goal of EMERGE is to help you flourish as a designer—in the areas of employment, growth, leadership, entrepreneurship, and life skills. </p> <p>Speakers:</p> <ul> <li>Autumn Heisler, Co-President, AIGA Cincinnati</li> <li>Nicola Cimino, Brand Manager, ConstructConnect</li> <li>Jess Nolte, Senior Designer, Differential </li> <li>Marquez White, UI Designer , Kroger</li> <li>Yelitsa Jean-Charles, Graphic Designer, LISNR</li> <li>Tim Metzner, Founder & Partner, Differential</li> <li>Matthew Dooley, CEO & Founder, Dooley Media</li> <li>Steve Bowling, HR Partner - Talent Acquisition & Engagement, LPK</li> <li>Lori Jerome, Account Executive, TEK Systems</li> <li>Brian Keenan, Co-Founder, Openfield</li> <li>Holly Shoemaker , Creative Director, Hyperquake</li> </ul> <p><a href="http://cincinnati.aiga.org/event/emerge-mini-conf/" class=button>Buy Your Tickets For This Event</a></p> </div> <div class=event id=keynote> <h3>Fri, Sept 29</h3> <h2>Keynote: Ashleigh Axios + #CDW17 After-Party</h2> <h4><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/QDpN15kQNap">Memorial Hall OTR // Theater</a> | 6 - 9:30 pm | $10 - $35</h4> <p>This isn't a portfolio presentation, humble-brag session, or a pure inspiration talk in the vein of "you can achieve this too." In this event, Ashleigh Axios will dish some of her awkward leadership moments and lessons, some of the challenges she's faced working in-house, her adjustment to remote working, and other adventures from her design career so far. You should attend this session if you like stories, animated GIFs, have a sense of humor, miss President Obama, use technology, and/or care about design. So you should probably just attend. </p> <p>Speaker:</p> <ul> <li>Ashleigh Axios, Design Exponent at Automattic</li> </ul> <p>About Ashleigh Axios: Ashleigh is the Design Exponent at Automattic, a company with the mission to democratize publishing and a passion for making the web a better place through products including WordPress.com. She is also an executive board member for AIGA, the professional association of design, and an editorial board member for Design Observer.

She is also the president emeritus of AIGA Washington D.C., where she formed and leads DotGovDesign, an initiative and annual conference connecting and empowering government designers.</p> <p>The After-Party: Following Ashleigh’s talk, join us for an amazing after-party. The #CDW17 after-party not only caps off an incredible keynote, but an inspiring week. This is the celebration of design in Cincinnati, with all of the people who make our creative community thrive. The after party is a time to relax, let loose, and connect with everyone you met and learned from that week. Enjoy a few cocktails, snack on some yummy bites, and dance to AIGA Cincinnati's favorite DJ. Meet the AIGA Cincinnati board, learn more about what we're planning for 2018, and have (so much) fun! There's no better way to start your weekend.</p> <p>Sponsored by Landor + Openfield</p> <p><a href="http://cincinnati.aiga.org/event/keynote-ashleigh-axios-cdw17-after-party/" class=button>Buy Your Tickets For This Event</a></p> </div> </div> </section> <section id=partners> <aside> <h1>Partners</h1> </aside> <div class=main> <h2>Presenting Partners</h2> <ul class=partners> <li><a href="http://aigacincinnati.org"><img src="images/partners/aiga-cincinnati.gif" alt="AIGA Cincinnati"></a></li> <li><a href="http://www.openfieldcreative.com/"><img src="images/partners/openfield-creative.jpg" alt="Openfield Creative"></a></li> </ul> <h2>Diamond Sponsor</h2> <ul class=partners> <li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/"><img src="images/partners/adobe.gif" alt=Adobe></a></li> </ul> <h2>Platinum Partner</h2> <ul class=partners> <li><a href="https://landor.com/"><img src="images/partners/landor.jpg" alt=Landor></a></li> </ul> <h2>Print Sponsor</h2> <ul class=partners> <li><a href="http://www.jakprints.com/"><img src="images/partners/jakprints.png" alt=Landor></a></li> </ul> <h2>Gold Partner</h2> <ul class=partners> <li><a href="http://i74wired.com/"><img src="images/partners/74-wired.jpg" alt="74 Wired"></a></li> </ul> <h2>Silver Sponsor</h2> <ul class=partners> <li><a href="https://www.peoplesliberty.org/"><img src="images/partners/peoples-liberty.jpg" alt="People's Liberty"></a></li> </ul> <h2>Supporting Sponsors</h2> <ul class=partners> <li><a href="https://curiosity360.com/"><img src="images/partners/curiosity-advertising.png" alt="Curiosity Advertising"></a></li> <li><a href="http://www.hyperquake.com/"><img src="images/partners/hyperquake.gif" alt=Hyperquake></a></li> <li><a href="https://www.americansignmuseum.org/"><img src="images/partners/americansignmuseum.jpg" alt="American Sign Museum"></a></li> <li><a href="https://www.homeadvisor.com/c.Cincinnati.OH.html"><img src="images/partners/ha-logo-title-sm.png" alt="Home Advisor"></a></li> </ul> <h2>Event Partners</h2> <ul class=partners> <li><a href="https://www.mohawkconnects.com/"><img src="images/partners/mohawk.jpg" alt=Mohawk></a></li> <li><a href="https://emediadesign.co/"><img src="images/partners/emedia.jpg" alt="E Media"></a></li> <li><a href="https://d-impact.org/"><img src="images/partners/design-impact.jpg" alt="Design Impact"></a></li> <li><a href="http://www.millcraft.com/"><img src="images/partners/Millcraft-Logo_CMYK_C.jpg" alt="Design Impact"></a></li> </ul> </div> </section> <footer> <p class=leadin>Cincinnati Design Week is proudly organized by a small team of volunteers on the <a href="http://cincinnati.aiga.org/about-us/board-members/">AIGA Cincinnati board</a>.

			<h2>Agile Design: How to Fail Your Way to Success</h2>
			<h4><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/nrHaR6Kap9F2">Gaslight Software</a> | 6:00pm | $15 - $25</h4>
			<p>It’s easy to look at a gorgeous mature app--Uber, Instagram, you name it--and think it was born polished and perfect. But the road to digital product success is littered with failure (and that’s a good thing). At Gaslight, we practice an agile design process that’s based around iteration. Rather than go for perfect out of the gate, we work quickly, test with clients and end users, and iterate based on real-world feedback.</p>
			<p>In this session, we’ll give you a full run down on the agile design process. You’ll come away with enough knowledge to apply this approach to your next project.</p>
			<p>About <a href="https://teamgaslight.com/">Gaslight Software</a>:<br>Gaslight is an agile software development consultancy. We design and develop web and mobile apps for growth-minded companies—everyone from startups to the Fortune 100.</p>

			<h2>Designing for a Virtual Environment: A Tale of Two Workshops</h2>
			<h4><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/RnjSJRVcZDq">Contemporary Arts Center</a> | 6:00pm | $10 -$20 </h4>
			<p>Join Dr. Derek Ham and Helen Armstrong from NC State University as they get you up to speed on the current state of VR and give you ideas for physical prototyping exercises that anyone can try. Since the early days of flight simulators, designers have used mechanical and virtual environments to simulate real world experiences. Ham and Armstrong turn this on its head, using the real world, instead, to prototype for VR. You’ll leave with a fistful of resources and a burning desire to experiment with virtual reality.</p>
